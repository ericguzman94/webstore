# E-Commerce Webstore
This is a web application that I created for Software testing class.This Application is done using ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, C#, ENTITY FRAMEWORK and Microsoft SQL Server 2018. This application sells clothing and shoes. I created and implemtned the relational database using MS SQL Server and I connecte it to the application with the Entity Framework. I created dyanmic quieres that can be sued to fetch, insert, delete or modify the database. In the cart page I implemented a dynamic cart that would fetch for the cart databse and it would create the HTML to display the cart.
